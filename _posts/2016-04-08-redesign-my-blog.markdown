Yesterday I had changed my blog design, which is a bootstrap jekyll template. What can be better than using a bootstrap template? My previous blog's design I made from the jekyll's defaul template which is really simple and easy. But I want some really interesting which comes with bootstrap clean-blog template. You can see my old design below.

<span class="caption text-muted">My old design</span>

Hmm, quite good, but I want a really nice and maintainable blog. So I search for free bootstrap templates which I could turn into a jekyll blog. But there are already some ready-made bootstrap jekyll templates. You can see my new blog's design.

<span class="caption text-muted">My new design</span>

The template included the about and contact page but remove the contact because it requires php which you cannot execute on GithubPages. It also included social icons and most important (for me) it comes with pagination which I could not hack at this time. I don't change the home and about page header images at this time.
