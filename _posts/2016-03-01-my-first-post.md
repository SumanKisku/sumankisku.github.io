Hi I am Suman Kisku from India. I am intrested in front-end web development.
I have already learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So everything that I would learn, I will share on this blog. So this year my target will be
to polish my front-end development skills.

## Learn the Advance of:

1. HTMl
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

The list is short because I am a student so I have to manage my studies. But I will
regularly practice and share my codes on [github](https://github.com/SumanKisku). And also
share on this board what I will learn.
