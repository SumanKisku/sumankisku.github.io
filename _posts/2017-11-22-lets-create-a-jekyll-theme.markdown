For some days I have been looking for projects for my portfolio. So, I had signed up a challange called 30Days30Site. But making a complete website every day was not possible for me. So I decided to move on. Then yesterday listning to a FreeCodeCamp podcast I found a new CSS framework called [PaperCSS](https://getpapercss.com) and I just searched it on Github. After watching it I thought let's make something with it. So, after thinking a while I had an idea to make a jekyll theme for my portfolio.

So, before opening the code editor I have a plan to create the jekyll theme. Trello would be great for the project management. I have some steps in my head.

## Steps to accomplish the project

1. Wireframing
2. Design on PhotoShop
3. Create a basic template with HTML and CSS
4. Giving the blog functionality with liquiq programming language

These are the basic steps I have in my head right now. So my next will be to jump in Trello board.
